  <h1> ABOUT</h1>
  <h2> ZEBRAS </h2>
  <p> Zebras are the type of animals who are wise, living in a old world <br>
    Black and white world, With the beauty of only 2 colors, their world<br>
    is so old that in movies, we see Dinasorus in colors, but Zebra in only Black and White.
    
  </p>

  <br>

  <h2> Why Only in BLACK and WHITE?</h2>
  <p> They are so old, they love to Live in black and White<br>
  they are so classic, and love to live in old world, such a peace!<br>
  They are very good animals, they don't harm us.</p>

<br>

  <h2> CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p> They are so good animals that<br>
  They don't harm us... humans in today's world are being more selfish<br>
  and harmful, we should not hunt animals, or kill them.<br> 
  You may ask - <br>
  Why going off topic, why on hunting and about humanity??<br>
  see, many peoples are harming our forests and animals, that causes air pollution<br>
which is very harmful to out nature as you might know!</p>
